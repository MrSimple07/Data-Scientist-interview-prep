        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- Firstly, for each document, LDA randomly assigns words to topic\n",
        "- Secondly, It iteratively adjusts these assignments to maximize the likelihood that the observed words fit the inferred topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, output:\n",

        "1. Topics as lists of words (e.g., \"dog, cat, pet\" for a \"pets\" topic).\n",
        "2. Document-topic distributions (e.g., 60% \"pets\", 40% \"food\").\n",
        "\n",
        "So basically, it does cluster of words, distribution of words in the text, and distribution of topics in the text, and gives the probability of topic names for the segment.\n",

        "\n",
        "Differences from LDA:\n",
        "1. Document Representation: BERTopic uses dense embeddings from BERT, capturing semantic meaning, while LDA relies on bag-of-words representations.\n",
        "2. Clustering: BERTopic uses clustering algorithms (e.g., UMAP + HDBSCAN) to group documents, while LDA uses probabilistic inference.\n",

        "1. K-Means Clustering: Groups documents into a predefined number of clusters based on similarity.\n",
        "2. Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree-like structure of clusters, allowing for multi-level grouping.\n",
        "3. DBSCAN: Clusters documents based on density, identifying outliers as noise.\n",
        "4. Spectral Clustering: Uses graph theory to cluster documents based on their similarity matrix."
